description: I read once that in our heads there are 30 shitty ideas to every genius one. I also severely underestimated how true this saying actually is.

Experienced designers in my life always told me to properly explore every idea I had. It started off in high school, where my art teacher insisted I drew someone's nose a hundred times. It continued in university where the lecturers demanged to see a minimum of 30 sketches before I even touched colour. It continued when I went into graphic design, after finishing university. My boss would send me back to the drawing board if I had less than 30 ideas on paper before I approached him for feedback.

Then when I got into UX this need for exploration and iteration sort of stopped. Because I was working with stakeholders directly no one asked me to make 30 iterations of the same idea. They needed 3 at most. And this is where the danger lies. It's not like the shitty ideas disappeared from my head. It's more like I got a little bit lazy and started jumping to solutions I didn't fully think through.

Another danger is that no one will notice this. You can go on for years—churning out shitty, half assed ideas into the world—and no one will say I thing. After all you're the expert. You are trusted to know how many iterations and pieces of exploration you really need before calling something 'done'.

So this is a reminder to all those designers out there who got a little bit lazy with their designs. Iterate. I don't care if you're moving some stupid legal copy around a box. Make 30 ideas. Make 100 if you need to. Be critical of your work. Just assume it's shit. Get some of that artist's angst in there! Even if you end up coming back to your first idea anyway—at least you will know it's good.
