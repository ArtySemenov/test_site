description: What I—a UX designer—actually do is a point of great confusion for many of my friends, family and strangers on the internet. It seems that only the chosen minority don't go "and what is that exactly?" when presented with the term.

## Where do UX designers come from?
I think that a lot of confusion about what a UX designer does is due to the fact that there are so many ways you can become one. I totally lucked into this position after finishing a masters in manufacturing and product innovation (a.k.a MSc Digital Creativity). There are a couple of "flavours" of a UX designer I've met in the wild. Here are a few:

### 1. Product design on steroids
Very basically, a product designer got tired of building chairs and hospital equipment all day, sat down at a computer and said, "I want to build digital products now.". Websites, apps, digital interfaces. Whatever it may be, a product designer will use her kick-ass understanding of human centered design techniques to research, conceptualise, prototype and test a digital product. That person will know how to set up a cycle of testing and iteration and lay out a strategy map for the year ahead. One weakness of this type of designer is lack of practical knowledge of how websites are actually built, so many pick up skills in front end development at some point in their careers.

### 2. Graphic designer transitioned
This flavour of UX designer came from a background of pushing blocks of text around an InDesign document. They spent their days laying out magazines, sketching leaflets and getting printers quotes on the phone. Then one day a client asked them to design an email campaign, or a small page of the website, and voila! We have a freshly baked user interface designer. Some get more interested in the conceptual stage of design, so they go into UX. The others stay as UI designers. Graphic designer's weakness is the same as the one of a product designer—a fairly basic understanding of code.

### 3. Front end dev/system administrator
These talented dudes come from an age when web design all about churning out cool-ass pages in Dreamweaver. They entered the industry early on to take top places in the management ranks from an era when a sysadmin was responsible for everything on the site, from people's experience to the colour of the footer. These UX designers tend to be older and more experienced. As with anything code related, they systematically learned everything there is to learn about designing websites.

### 4. Completely random place
Like me, I did 3D art, moved into product design, played around with virtual reality while writing a masters thesis on it, then became a graphic designer, and only then lucked out into a full time UX design position. I've heard a lot of random UX design origin stories. The best one I think was about a middle aged lady who just taught herself the skills required and went off looking for jobs at networking events. Kudos to her, she's now a junior UX designer at quite a large firm everyone's heard about.

## What skills do UX designers have?
This is going to be a very short section. Open up any link on Google called "UX jobs" and read what they wrote there. You'll hear things like "human centered design" and "conducting research" and so on. It is slightly unfortunate that not many companies know what a UX designer is and why they need one. I heard phrases like, "just add a little bit more UX here" in the past, which is totally not what this is about. And just to be clear, this is not supposed to be an in depth analysis of product design methodologies. Just a brief overview of what's actually involved.

### Design
This is why any type of designer is a great match for the job. The skills you pick up as a professional problem solver are very transferable. Not that people are going to quiz you on the kerning of your _h1_ tag, or complain about incorrectly picked texture. But the basic fact of taking a problem, dissecting it into tiny pieces, researching alternative solutions, coming up with ideas and—most importantly—testing your ideas; this is where it's at.

### Prototyping
This is where the ex-front-end devs excel and us, non-technical folk, rely on InVision click-throughs. Every designer should prototype. Whether it's making a chair from wood and wool, making a pair of trousers from scraps of old bedding, or in fact spinning up an entire user flow through your website—all these types of prototype is the heart of good design.

### Research
There are many methods one could employ to come up with ideas. Graphic designers go to Pinterest and consult historic design collections, concept artists scroll through hundreds of pages of reference material, product designers and ux designers reach out to end user and ask them questions like, "is this easy to use?" and "what would you do if you saw this?". Good research skills is another little something that unites all designers together. Research also includes testing of your prototypes.

Is my idea successful? I dunno. Go and test it on real users.

### Communication
Now that your idea is well researched, designed, prototyped and tested we need to present it to the other stakeholders. These might be clients, the product manager you're working with, even your CEO. Putting findings together into nice presentations and making sense when talking is extremely important. Your ideas might be amazing but if you can't sell them to the audience, then you're pretty much screwed.

## Conclusion
So what does a UX designer actually do? When all CVs are filled and all diplomas checked, in essence, what we do is this: we enable people do things with technology they never thought possible. This quote is not mine, but it really resonated with me.

If you want a dictionary-like explanation, a user experience designer is a person who uses design methodologies to design digital products.
