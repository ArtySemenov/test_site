description: Last year's been a blast. I moved 250 miles south from rainy Scotland to slightly less rainy Cheshire, England, to work for one of the largest price comparison websites in UK. I learned a lot in the first year. Possibly more than in the entire 5 years of my study. In this post I'm talking about some of these things, and how I grew both professionally, and as a person.

### You know nothing, Jon Sno'

As cheesy as it sounds, I fell into the trap of thinking I know something my colleagues did not. If you are reading this, I am sorry ðŸ˜¬. One particular comes to mind when I wanted to tell my colleague that you can export SVGs directly from illustrator by copypasting them. Having discovered this amazing feature myself only a few days before, I was sure I found the holy grail of all design thinking. Thankfully I didn't get a chance to tell him that, but the cringe was real. And it kinda applies to everything. The trick is always assume the other person knows what you are talking about. It is only nowâ€”a year onâ€”that I have to sometimes explain new concepts to other people. Feels good.

### There is <em>always</em> time to prototype

You'd be surprised how many people will approach you and say something along the lines of, "hey, we need this journey quickly illustrated, just a few quick wireframes is all we need!". If you are anything like me, you'll take these words at face value. I severely underestimated the power of a hastily put together click-through prototype. It ends up in an endless cycle of clarifications and confusion. So just save yourself the hassle down the line and stick your drawings into InVision or similar.

### Prepare to fight for your ideas

Not literally, but be prepared to stand up for yourself. Don't be a dick about it. Being offended and shutting off is different than replying to a piece of critique with, "I thought about that, it won't work in this context because of X. Also, our research shows that 10% of users click our here, which means Y". See the difference?

It gets even worse when you are chatting to other stakeholders from around the business. Business development managers, product managers, members of the exec, they always have their own ideas about how and why something should or shouldn't work. Make sure you come prepared, with lots of data to backup your arguments.

### Sneaky requests
Following on from my last point look out for phrases such as:

- "well, just try this and see how it goes"
- "how about we go with this for now and then fix it later on"
- "sounds great! This is exactly how I want this to work"
- "I know you said doing X is against our users wishes but Linda from commercial spoke to one of the suppliers and they totally loved the idea"
- "do you have a minute for a quick chat?"
- "can I ask you a quick question?"

Generally there are a couple of approaches to things depending on how much you want to piss off that person much above yourself in the corporate food chain. I tend to go with a non-committal "I'll see what I can do, let's catch up about this at the end of the week". By the end of the week I'd have spoken to someone with more authority or dug up some old bit of research that supports my argument.

### Trust in thy manager
Because UX is a fairly young industry that is just starting to properly mature, we are incredibly lucky that most people who've been here from the start are not that much older than us (I'm talking about 20-something-year-old millennials here). This means that these guys are extremely dedicated to prove out the value of UX, see their team succeed and see their direct reports achieve their goals. Make sure you develop a friendly relationship with your manager as this person has to deal with <em>all</em> the bull from my previous point.

### Some general thoughts

- that groundbreaking idea or insight is definitely not as groundbreaking as you think
- don't be discouraged by this
- don't be discouraged by ideas not making it past design, next time someone needs a solution, you'll pull one out with a sardonic smirk
- go to as many events and conferences as possible. Talk to people. You'll get contacts and cool perspectives
