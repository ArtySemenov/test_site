[Jesmond Allen](https://twitter.com/jesmond) presented a great talk about how task modelling has served information architects and UX designers for many years. We felt this was a great way to communicate our research findings with the wider business and senior stakeholders. We had a huge volume of user research accumulated over the course of several years and we were keen to sink our teeth into it. But let's start at the very beginning.

## What is task modelling?
Not quite a journey map, not quite a service blue print. A task model maps what's important to the users. It's a great way to get into their head and really see what parameters they are basing their decisions on. Another great thing about task modelling is that a journey map might need to be updated fairly often. Task model is not likely to change, unless something drastic happens to the design or the users' mental models.

### Some examples of task models

## So how do you build a task model?
### 1. Start with research
Thankfully, working in a big company, we had historic qualitative data from various user testing sessions. Plus we just ran a user interview session where we interviewed 6 people over the course of a day. Not everyone has the same amount of data, so as a first step the advice is to organise a few interviews and figure out the journey steps. It's important here to understand _your_ users, because—to use Jesmond's example—"work shirt" can mean literally anything to a huge number of people from different professions.

### 2. Identify common steps and things people find important
We took all our notes and stuck them on a wall. We then started moving sticky notes around trying to figure out common steps. This is a team exercise and we quickly ended up with clusters of sticky notes we felt are representative of our users. Bring down those 100+ sticky notes into an easy to understand sequence of steps that might include something like:

1. decide to switch energy
2. compare various deals
3. pick a deal you like
4. switch to that tariff

Then you'll have things that are important to the users at any stage of the journey. When picking a deal people might look at price and the potential brand. We ended up with an A2 board filled with 5–6 steps and about 12 things people found important while switching energy, from price to brand.

### 3. Make the map
Magic goes here. Here I just sat down and made the thing in a similar format you saw before. Here are a couple of things I picked up elsewhere on the web:

#### Sequence
A sequential relationship of tasks. For example: 1. poop 2. wipe.

#### Decision circle
Circular relationship of concepts that are related but the user jumps from one to the other and back. For example: I care about price, but I also want a good brand, but I don't want the price to be too big. These relationships make for perfect filtering functionality.

#### Loose relationship
This is an amorphous blob of loosely related things. In energy world it can be various questions users might have before making the decision to switch. In other fields, they can be various questions, concerns and sticking points that are important to some customers.

### 4. Present your task model
This step sometimes gets overlooked. Don't overlook it. Once the task model was finished we presented it first to the product manager and then the rest of the team. It generated discussion and I'm pretty sure I saw someone using it as an illustration for a point they were trying to make. Mission = success!
