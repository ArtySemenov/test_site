description: I'm currently sitting in a dark room looking at someone stumbling through our newest design from behind a one way mirror. With every error 7 pens hit the sticky notes with a similar sounding note, "participant struggled to find the continue link on the form". All I can think about is the immense amount of post it notes we'll need to sort through on Monday. What a drag. So how do you deal with the equivalent of big data in qualitative research?

For most people out there getting a senior stakeholder into the observation room is a fantastic opportunity to promote human centered design in the organisation. Getting people bought into the testing sessions is a challenge that can be discussed for ever. But say you're on the other side of that process? What happens when 8 pairs of eyes produce 20–30 notes per participant? How do we deal with a pile of 240 post it notes that are going to be waiting for us on Monday morning?

The solution is: **back room facilitation.** Basically, with one person controlling and filtering what notes make it on the wall, in theory, it becomes easier to manage the high volume of data. Here is how to do this well.

## Prepare the back-room
To manage high velocity data well you'll need to run around collecting notes. It pays the prepare the room beforehand. I usually begin by placing several A2 sheets of paper on the wall and writing journey steps on each. This way when there is a pause in the interview, you can get up and quickly place some post its in the relevant area. It also becomes a little bit easier to sort through them the next day.

## Facilitate the back-room
With such a high volume of data produced it is necessary to filter for repetitions. You can't have 14 notes saying pretty much the same thing on the wall. We discovered that one person facilitating the back-room helps a lot. I tend to be that facilitator, while my colleague is performing the interviews. All observers take notes and once in a while—maybe in between steps in the journey—I get up, take the little piles of postits and place them on the relevant step in the journey.

## Take some notes yourself
The best thing is that there is no pressure on you to take notes. This allows you to sit back and really observe what is happening in the interview room. You'd be amazed how many cool ideas you end up thinking of while absent mindedly waiting for the next batch of notes. If you feel like it, get up and place some notes of your own. I tend to notice things that others don't because my line of reasoning is, "okay, 8 people just mentioned the blue link, I'll look at what the participant is saying about the navigation".

## Run an unpack workshop
Gone are the days of a lone user researcher sitting alone in a room going through hundreds of hand written notes. Viva la cross-functional teams! Get everyone back in. Get them to go through the notes with you. It benefits everyone and everyone can get behind the insight we got all together. The workshop runs in four stages:

1. **Unpack:** get all the sheets on the walls by the participant and invite some people in to join you (important! bring snacks)
2. **Sort:** get people into groups of two and ask them to collect the most important bits of insight from each participant
3. **Synthesis:** once the amount of notes went down from 240 to around 30–40 you can place them on a clear bit of wall and group them, you'll end up with multiple categories and themes
4. **Come up with some ideas:** together with a product manager or someomne senior identify the most important and profitable areas of opportunity and create a backlog
5. **Follow through:** don't forget to put everything into a deck and the ideas can go into a Trello board

So unless you want to have to sift through hundreds of notes, step up and take control of the backroom. And train your colleagues to do it too. It sped up our process at least twofold.
