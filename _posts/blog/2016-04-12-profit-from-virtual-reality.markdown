description: We’ve all seen the benefits of virtual prototypes. We know that virtual reality is widely used in automotive industry to reduce time, cost and risk for the designers. But where do we go from here? How can we make it better and irreplaceable? Below are some possible answers based on academic research.

I’m in the finishing stages of finishing my masters thesis on virtual reality in design. While wading through the vast sea of academic literature on the topic of CAD/CAM, virtual prototyping and virtual reality in design I came across the following journal paper. It is in press. It means that the article has been accepted for publication, peer reviewed, and is due to appear shortly, but hasn’t been published just yet. I like articles like these. They seem to be on the absolute forefront of innovation. There is literally nothing known about something beyond these. Personally, I think it’s an absolute gem. The article is called: Future directions for the development of virtual reality within an automotive manufacturer by Glyn Lawson, Davide Salanitri and Brian Waterfield. It opens up some extremely lucrative business opportunities for the savvy entrepreneur.

The paper is built around an interview conducted with senior engineers at Jaguar Landrover. The sample size is 11, which is not a huge amount until you consider who these people are. The average experience at JLS is 16.1 years and they have been using or have expressed interest in using VR as part of their process. The questions were varied and mostly tried to find what the current uses are and what the problems are. Below is a list of current uses:

- To experience the vehicle architecture
- To assess vision
- To gain a perception of a surface move (i.e. to obtain a subjective experience of a geometry modification)
- To study access to tanks containing fluid
- For design evaluations
- To calibrate perception (i.e. demonstrating design intent before experiencing a prototype vehicle which may not represent design
- intent exactly)
- For motion capture of manufacturing tasks
- For reviews of driving position
- To solve issues during stakeholder reviews
- To evaluate noise characteristics
- For overlaying vehicle geometry (desktop)
- For ergonomics analysis on desktop simulations

This is a wealth of information right here. Only from this list someone could potentially build a comprehensive, multiplatform virtual reality system, tailored for the automotive business. But what are the problems? And how can we capitalise on them? Well the paper has the answers. Now straight to the point, 9 recommendations on where virtual reality research can head in the future. The reader can extrapolate the profitability of each from the information given. Enjoy!

### Address issues with depth perception in virtual reality
The interview revealed issues with depth perception with VR technology. Research has shown that rich virtual environments with textured background surfaces decrease the underestimation of depth presence. Video games anyone? Research has also shown that using shadows helped participants differentiate between objects. Again, video games? If only someone could adjust a video game engine to accommodate automotive CAD/CAM processes.

### Provide haptic feedback for more robust ergonomics investigations
Haptic feedback has long been a difficult beast to nail down. In essence it is the ability to receive touch feedback on anything you do. Imagine a driving wheel of a car simulator that behaves like it would if it was attached to some tyres. In ergonomics discipline it is established that muscular effort and physical stress can lead to discomfort and injuries. Therefore it must be assessed as part of an ergonomics evaluations. Though individual devices exist, such as gloves or pens. If someone implemented a haptic arm with force feedback for complex gross-motor tasks, it would be swell. Especially if it also simulated vibration, torque and force required to lift weights.

### Implement collision detection
Human to object, object to object, it doesn’t matter. When collision detection is implemented it will add greater validity for manufacturing assessments and overpass limitations of desktop CAD modelling. Video games have been doing it for years, but how can we implement it in engineering design context?

### Improve multi-sensory feedback
This has been the ultimate dream for virtual reality enthusiasts for decades. A fully immersive virtual reality that stimulates all the senses. In design context it means the introduction of 3D sound for manufacturing and switchgear assessments and olfactory simulation for air quality and market investigations. In addition to task-specific benefits, this is likely to increase presence in the virtual environment.

### Use a markless body tracker system
I think movie industry would be quite keen to see this also. Having no cumbersome markers on the suit means representation of a range of body types in ergonomics investigations and to avoid the difficulties associated with donning a marker-based tracking system. This should include high accuracy hand  tracking, for ergonomics assessment and for digital reproduction of the hands.

### Provide virtual contexts, including a driveable road scene
This one doesn’t even need description. CAVEs (Cave Automaticic Virtual Environment) are great but imagine actually driving your prototype in a beautifully rendered race track, with accurate physics and… wait, are we just talking about video games again? Why isn’t someone doing this?

### Provide fluid/flexible part simulations
For higher fidelity assessments of manufacturing and service tasks. Again, video games have been doing it for years. Next time you fire up your Maya RealFlow plugin, think about those poor souls in manufacturing who don’t need to wait for 17 hours to simulate water flow. The above statement is a bit contradictory. Games have been doing this for years, true. But even in games and VFX, liquid simulation is a difficult subjects. Higher fidelity simulations take a very long time, but it is, in theory possible.

### Use VR for market research
This is an interesting one. The paper states that it is to reduce costs and difficulties of transporting physical properties to various locations. This can be done so, so simply. Drop a model in Unreal Engine 4 and off you go market researching.

### Implement networked 3D technology with desktop 3D visualisation
The paper states that the main difficulty with virtual reality is that it is too expensive to do in house. This means that engineers must travel to dedicated virtual reality centres. The logistics, costs and difficulties are apparent. If only you could stick your headset on, connect to a multi-player… I mean, multi-user server and do your virtual reality assessments there. Maybe you can also get a cool hat for your avatar.

In the future, when games completely merge with CAD/CAM processes, engineers will benefit from custom made novelty hats.

Joking aside however. This paper demonstrates several excellent avenues of possible future research and development in virtual reality industry. It is limited in that the sample size is, though quality, is fairly small. Also only people who are interested or already use virtual reality were approached. But next the less the problems are apparent, the solutions are out there and we are encouraged to keep developing quality virtual reality software and content for the benefit of others. Video games might be the answer. As a video games artist I cannot be objective on this front. However the use of video games for visualisation, simulation, and training are good indicators that we are headed for a merging of the industries. Look even at Unigine. It came out in 2015 and is already offering virtual reality benefits directly to CAD/CAM process. Maybe I’m beist. Maybe it’s simply true – video games offer substantial benefits to the world of engineering design.
