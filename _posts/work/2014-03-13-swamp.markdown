A very hasty, initial sketch of the Baba Yaga's hut simply to establish general mood and character. I was envisioning something more grand and impressive than a simple hut in the forest, but sometimes less is more.

As Mike Yamada said in Skillful Huntsman, these initial sketches are important to get all the cliches out of your head. This image is what appears in my mind when I hear "Baba Yaga's hut", so it is extremely useful to get it out of my system.

I also used this exercise to explore the possibilities that become available when using non standard composition methods. Instead of normal rule of thirds I used the Golden Ratio, or the Fibonacci spiral. Here it is in action.

Although I hate putting my work next to other people's, because usually mine is more rushed and unfinished. Here are the images I used as inspiration and reference.

I learned a lot through this project. From setting up basic composition to the correct use of different hard and soft edged brushes.
